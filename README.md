# Cinder-PureDataNode

Adds Pure Data audio processing support to [cinder](https://github.com/cinder/Cinder) with [libpd](https://github.com/libpd/libpd).

### Requires Cinder-Audio2

currently found [here](https://github.com/richardeakin/Cinder-Audio2), clone that and this repo to your cinder blocks directory.

This was mainly built for testing the extensibility of ci::audio2 and is not fully featured.  If there are features you'd like to see added, please open issues or pull requests.

cheers!
