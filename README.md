# Cinder-PureDataNode

Adds Pure Data audio processing support to [cinder](https://github.com/cinder/Cinder) with [libpd](https://github.com/libpd/libpd).

### Requires Cinder's github audio2 branch

found [here](https://github.com/cinder/Cinder/tree/audio2).

This was mainly built for testing the extensibility of ci::audio's modular functionality and is not fully featured.  If there are features you'd like to see added, please open issues or pull requests.

cheers!
